# hello-world
Pretty much says it all.
Editing the readme.
Trying an edit from the local repository.
Now we're going to practice merge conflicts and changing remotes.  Readme changed on the local repo, uploaded to master from branch.
Changing readme again locally, still on branch.
Next, we will see whether github actually makes a new branch if it doesn't exist.
